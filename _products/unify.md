## description
Think of Us is currently developing an evidence-informed coaching app called Unify, which provides young people with interactive videos, self-coaching activities, and planning tools to help them identify and set personal goals, while also providing a framework to achieve them. Through the platform, users become equipped to face everyday challenges, such as renting an apartment or reconnecting with biological family. The app also connects the young person with advocates and care providers, forming a personal support network. The Santa Clara County Department of Children and Families and the Washington D.C Department of Behavioral Health, have agreed to pilot Unify.
