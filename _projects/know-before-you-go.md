## Alliance for Children's Rights

If you are an older foster youth, you know that life is hectic, scary, stressful and confusing. To survive and thrive you need to stay tuned into the people, places and programs that can support you as you build your life outside of foster care. Know Before You Go (B4UGO) is the best way for current and foster youth in Los Angeles County to stay connected to information, people and services designed just for you. With a quick tap on your phone, you can be virtually linked to a lifeline of resources, tools, supports and advocates who know where and how to help you.

It is easy to use. Say you are looking for housing, then just go to the map listing for transitional or shelter housing, and the ones closest to you will pop up on your map. If you are hooked to GPS, you can even get directions to get there. Whether you are in Los Angeles, Lancaster/Palmdale, Long Beach or anywhere in the county, there are great choices for housing, food, transportation, school, jobs, healthcare, etc. Or, if you want to talk to an advocate or your attorney about something thatâ€™s bothering you or to help you find opportunities, you can also click on links and go directly to groups and organizations that specialize in transition-aged foster youth. You can also sign up for alerts when special events and programs for foster youth are announced, deadlines for financial aid, alerts on jobs for foster youth
and more.
