    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
      To connect foster youth, families, and service providers
      to innovate tools and resources while bridging gaps
      in child welfare technology.
    </p>
  </header>
  <p>
    We hope to get innovative, user-centric technology into the hands of
    child welfare stakeholders by aggregating and providing crowdsourced
    feedback on current products, connecting product ideas to developers
    and technical experts, and helping child welfare agencies procure
    better technology.

  <h1>The Problem</h1>

  <div class="stats container">

  </div>

  <p>
    Child welfare is full of problems in need of solutions. Social workers
    spend more time on data entry than interacting with families despite
    their prefernce, and families and youth who don't know about the services
    available to them and feel voiceless int eh monolothic child welfare
    system. Resource families don't have access to essential information
    about the children in their care, kinship guardians struggle to navigate
    a system that's new to them, and supervisors are unable to measure
    the success of new programs and policies in real time because of
    bureaucratic barriers. Innovative uses of data and technology can change
    this.
  </p>

  <h1>The Solution</h1>
  <p>
    {{ site.title | escape }} will be the one stop shop for all stakeholders
    looking to find, use, build, or scale products in child welfare. One
    functionality will be to aggregate and organize the products out there
    for the child welfare space, where they can be easily found and used.
    Another functionality will be to connect those who hope to scale or build
    products for child welfare to developers, designers, and other innovators
    who can help them achieve their goals. Finally, {{ site.title | escape }}
    will provide guidance to agencies hoping to procure better, more
    user-centered products and technology for their agencies.
